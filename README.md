# challenge_1

## Task

- Refactoring existing code to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

- An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for businessâ€”for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

- Accessibility can include complex requirements, but your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria for this project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

## User Story

- The user would like to optimize their site, for use within search engines, by adjusting the code to proper accessibility standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The task is complete when the webpage meets accessibility standards with semantic and logically structured HTML elemtents. Must be able to view alt attributes, heading attributes and the title elemnt. These must fall in sequential order and be descriptive.
